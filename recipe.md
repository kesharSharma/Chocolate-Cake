Step-by-step recipe to make chocolate cake:
 No mixer required for the batter, simply
 1) whisk the dry ingredients in one bowl.
 2) and the wet ingredients in another bowl.
 3) Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients (or vice versa, it doesn’t make any difference).
 4) add the hot coffee
 5) then whisk everything together.
 6) The cake batter is thin.
 7) Divide between 2 9-inch cake pans. You can easily stretch it to 3 or 4 8-inch or 9-inch cakes if needed. Or make a quarter sheet cake using a 9×13 inch cake pan.
